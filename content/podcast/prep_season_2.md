### {{< partial "mrk.html" >}}season 2 — music edition{{< partial "mrk2.html" >}}
### {{< partial "mrk.html" >}}guide to the story legacy podcast{{< partial "mrk2.html" >}}
#### my intention is to have a fun insightful conversation
#### you'll get to share:
- your story about music
- your art (live performance, during the show)
- message for future generations

### {{< partial "mrk.html" >}}flow + structure{{< partial "mrk2.html" >}}
1. enter virtual studio (streamyard) via browser {{< partial "br.html" >}} https://ramiro.me/podcast/studio {{< partial "br.html" >}} *i'll send a unique streamyard link in case that link goes to the wrong broadcast*
2. quick hello (1-2 min.)
3. we'll 'go live' on facebook and youtube (video and audio). the show is a live production. there is minimal to no post-editing done. this keeps it raw, authentic and spontaneous. the live broadcast will become the episode for the audio platforms (spotify, apple etc.)
4. i do the show intro + introduce you
5. opening question i might ask:{{< partial "br.html" >}}— “what’s the biggest challenge you’ve faced as a musician?”{{< partial "br.html" >}}— “what’s the most important lesson you’ve learned from music?”{{< partial "br.html" >}}— “what’s the scariest thing you've done as a musician?”
6. free flow space (30-40 min. fun insightful conversation, based on what you shared)
7. closing question:{{< partial "br.html" >}}— “what message do you have for people today, tomorrow, a thousand years from now?”
8. live raw performance (one song)
9. outro + 'kapow' {{< partial "br.html" >}} kapow is a celebration move at the end. it means breakthrough + growth. it goes like this:{{< partial "br.html" >}}— i’ll say, “you know how now”{{< partial "br.html" >}}— then together we say, “kapow!”
10. stop live broadcast
11. after show wrap up

#### everything 1-11 will be 60 to 90 min. max.
{{< partial "br.html" >}}
